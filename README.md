Fortnite Restrictor is a straightforward application designed to prevent excessive gameplay by managing when Fortnite can be played.

Usage Instructions:

- Initial Setup: The default password is "admin". You are encouraged to change this password upon first use for security reasons.

- Configuring Hours: Set the allowed gaming hours in the format: HH:MM-HH:MM or HH:MM-HH:MM, HH:MM-HH:MM. Each entry should consist of a starting and an ending hour. Note that the starting hour must be earlier than the ending hour, except for 00:00 to accommodate gaming past midnight (e.g., 19:00-23:59 is valid, where 00:00 indicates the start of the next day).

- Shortcut Creation: Use the 'Create Shortcut' button to generate a startup shortcut. This will automatically launch Fortnite Restrictor in silent mode when your PC boots.

- Deleting the Shortcut: If you need to remove the startup shortcut, simply press the 'Create Shortcut' button again. The startup folder will open, allowing you to manually delete the shortcut.

- Accessing Settings: Press CTRL+ALT+O at any time to open the control panel. You will need to enter your password to make any changes to the settings.

Additional Information:

- Ensure that the times set for game restriction are checked and adjusted periodically to accommodate changes in daily routines or special circumstances.
