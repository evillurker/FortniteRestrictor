Game Restrictor is a straightforward application designed to prevent excessive gameplay by managing when addictive games can be played.

Supported Games: Fortnite, World of Warcraft, Minecraft, Leauge of Legends, DOTA2, Grand Theft Auto V

Usage Instructions:

- Initial Setup: The default password is "admin". You are encouraged to change this password upon first use for security reasons.

- Configuring Hours: Set the allowed gaming hours in the format: HH:MM-HH:MM or HH:MM-HH:MM, HH:MM-HH:MM. Each entry should consist of a starting and an ending hour. Note that the starting hour must be earlier than the ending hour, except for 00:00 to accommodate gaming past midnight (e.g., 19:00-23:59 is valid, where 00:00 indicates the start of the next day).
So if you want your child to play on Friday night, and allow him to continue playing until 2AM that night for example, you'll need to set Friday to end at 23:59 (i.e. 21:00-23:59) and then set Saturday to 00:00-02:00.

- Configuring Games: Set the games you want to restrict by selecting the checkboxes after typing your password.

- Shortcut Creation: Use the 'Create Shortcut' button to generate a startup shortcut. This will automatically launch Game Restrictor in silent mode when your PC boots.

- Deleting the Shortcut: If you need to remove the startup shortcut, simply press the 'Create Shortcut' button again. The startup folder will open, allowing you to manually delete the shortcut.

- Accessing Settings: Press CTRL+ALT+O at any time to open the control panel. You will need to enter your password to make any changes to the settings.

Additional Information:

- Ensure that the times set for game restriction are checked and adjusted periodically to accommodate changes in daily routines or special circumstances.

If your child already knows how to close tasks in Windows Task Manager, you can restrict that by doing the following on his user:

Open Group Policy Editor:

    Press Win + R to open the Run dialog.
    Type gpedit.msc and press Enter.

Navigate to Task Manager Settings:

    Go to User Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> System -> Ctrl+Alt+Del Options.

Disable Task Manager:

    Find the setting Remove Task Manager and double-click on it.
    Set it to Enabled to disable access to the Task Manager.

Apply the Changes:

    Click Apply, then OK.
    The changes should take effect immediately, or you may need to restart the computer.
